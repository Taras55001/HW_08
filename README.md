# Birthday Reminder

This Python script, `birthdays_per_week.py`, helps you find and display birthdays in the upcoming week and on the weekend (Saturday and Sunday). It uses the Faker library to generate random user data with birthdays.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Faker library (install using `pip install faker`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Taras55001/HW_08.git
    cd HW_08
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python birthdays_per_week.py
    ```

## Output

The script will display birthdays in the upcoming week and on the weekend. If no birthdays are found, it will indicate that there are no birthdays in the next week.

## Example

Here is an example output:

`Birthdays in Saturday and Sunday (YYYY-MM-DD - YYYY-MM-DD):
John Doe 2000-01-15`

`Birthdays in the next week (YYYY-MM-DD - YYYY-MM-DD):
Jane Smith 1985-02-20
Bob Johnson 1992-05-10`


Feel free to modify and integrate this script into your projects.
